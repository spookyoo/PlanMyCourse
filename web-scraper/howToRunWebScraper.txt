Before running the scraper make sure you have 
a database/schema in mySQL you want to import the data into.
Once you have a database/schema
create a .env file inside the web-scraper directory with the following attributes

    DB_USER= <Your username for mySQL >
    DB_PASS= <Your password for mySQL>
    DB_HOST= <The host (You can usually just have "localhost" for this)>
    DB_NAME= <The name of the database/schema you want to import the data into>


Once you have all of the above configured you can start the following:

    cd web-scraper folder

    Create a Virtual Environment:
        On Linux/Mac run:
            python3 -m venv env
            source env/bin/activate

        On Windows run:
            python -m venv env
            env\Scripts\activate

    than run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    to start the scraper run:
        On Linux/Mac:
            python3 courseScraper.py 

        On Windows:
            python courseScraper.py

    if any import or mySQL errors happen
        run:
            pip install --upgrade mysql-connector-python
