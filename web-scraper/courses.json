Many of the processes affecting the planet today are rooted in our past, as many of the actions we see today were produced by and had impacts upon past societies. Similarly, past societies were forced to deal with the effects of climate change, a problem with which our current society is struggling. A better understanding of how these situations arose in the past may help us to better discern general principles that continue to operate today, and thus plan toward our future.\n",

Students will engage in a variety of contemporary readings and discussions and will be required to produce an original research paper that integrates archaeological and anthropological literature in a (previously-approved) topic of their choice. While weekly topics will vary from year to year, they will be grouped under one or more of five broad themes: Power, Identity, Community, Conflict, and Body. Topics covered will be timely and responsive to current events. This course will require active engagement by students, rather than passive absorption of lecture material. Assessment will be based on class participation, presentation, and an iterative series of writing assignments (a research paper proposal, annotated bibliography, and original research paper).

The information and skills learned in this course will enable students to take an interdisciplinary approach to an emerging and complex set of problems which medical professionals themselves are not currently being trained to deal with. To this end, the course requires each student to do a research project on a specific problem arising from a paradox inherent in contemporary Western medicine: while knowledge of traditional medical terminology is still required for medical professionals (in fact, its use is ever-expanding), it is now being used by a third and even fourth generation of people who don't understand the word-parts and principles on which this terminology is based. More pragmatically, the course will prepare students to take a lead in dealing with this new and poorly understood category of potential medical error: those which arise from failures of accurate communication between health care professionals, failures with potentially serious consequences to health care in general, and to patients in particular.",

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to learn the basics of dramatic writing, with a focus on writing for the stage. The course is intended for students with little to no previous University-level writing experience, but who have an intense interest in theatre. The specific dramaturgical approach employed in the course focuses on the actor/character relationship to text, where the actor is always the first audience of any script. In that the actor is ultimately responsible for interpreting the text (through performance to the audience), it is the playwright's goal to create a script that both challenges and engages the actor. The craft of writing plays is explored through exercises and class discussion, and the course focuses on First Nations and Métis cultural concerns.",

    "subject": "FREN",
    "number": 315,
    "class_name": "FREN315",
    "description": "This course aims to build sensitive, thoughtful, and informed translators with the linguistic skills and cultural knowledge to properly transfer French-language Indian Residential School documents to readers of English. Translating Indian Residential School documents is an overwhelming task, foremost because of the horrors they depict and the impact on generations of Survivors. Other challenges include the sheer volume of documents, the time constraints posed by the urgency to access their content, and often opaque handwriting and terminology. This course is designed to address both orders of difficulties: the first half of each class is led by Indigenous scholars and community members to provide context and help translators process the information in these documents. The second half of each class sees this knowledge practically applied to translations of document excerpts, as students analyze their work for accuracy, openly discuss process, and troubleshoot any online translation tools used for this application.",

    "description": "Large datasets are common in the geosciences. Effective processing of these data require \nthem to be structured, preferably utilising database systems. Visualisation and representation of the \ncharacteristics of the data are typically best performed using robust, non-parametric procedures which \nemphasise unusual data. Data which vary with both time and space require special treatment and \npresentation when utilising GIS or plate reconstruction models. This course provides an introduction to \nstructuring data, the development of project-specific databases, time-slider variations in GIS, plate \nreconstruction modelling and geochemical data visualisation. It draws on skills learned in igneous, \nsedimentary and metamorphic geology, together with introductory GIS courses to teach students how to more effectively work with large deep earth-time datasets. These insights and approaches will position the student better for later geology classes such as GEOL 406 and GEOL 465 and for most exploration work environments.",

Health is widely defined to capture experiences that fall outside the traditional doctor-patient relationship, and to explore issues including: mental health; the politics of healthcare; health economies; the health professions; disease’s power to shape human history.  These courses rely on a variety of sources: food and nutrition, to medical treatises, patient narratives, activist and anti-medical establishment texts, artwork, and institutional reports, and a rich historical tradition of examining health and medicine and its influence on human history.

Identities are never ‘fixed’ or constructed in isolation; they are always both ‘invented’ and the result of historical change. Communities are similarly complex: never autonomous, always shaped by history and the interplay between internal dynamics and relationships with forces outside of the community. All sections of this course are linked through their exploration of the history of identities and communities but they explore that history in different places and times. Some courses will take a micro-level view, exploring the history of identity in one particular location or community over time and relating those changes to broader perspectives; others will look at the way broad historical forces shaped identities. Possible areas of exploration may include: historical roots and myths surrounding so called \"tribalism\" in Africa and the contemporary impacts of this discourse; the spread nationalism in the 18th and 19th centuries and the rise of the modern nation-state; how such groups as Kurds have been able to maintain a distinct identity over time; Quebec’s status as a separate ‘nation’ in Canada.",

We'll also examine how animals were cared for, from animal husbandry to the beginnings of veterinary medicine. We'll analyze the myriad roles that animals played in classical literature to shed light on expectations and ideals for human life. We’ll see that some viewed them as mere tools for human use, while others viewed them as rational, moral beings deserving of just treatment. Ultimately, we'll see that it is only by examining society’s relationship with animals that we can understand the human experience in the Greco-Roman world.",

Some of the questions we will ask include: Where can we find connections or discontinuities? How can – and cannot – textual and archaeological sources help us understand people and their daily lives? How have Chinese thinkers, leaders, religious professionals, and ordinary people understood the past and used it to address pressing concerns even today? Part of your task as a student is to pay attention to recurring themes and topics presented, draw comparisons, and ask your own questions.",

Two overarching questions will shape our investigation:  what internal and external factors allowed Rome to extend its empire first over Italy and then over the Mediterranean basin? Why did the government of Rome by the SPQR - the senate and people of Rome - the system called the Republic- ultimately fail and fall to civil war and a monarchy established by Julius Caesar and his successors? Seeking answers to these questions will entail the exploration not only of events and actors in Roman history but also the underlying political and social factors that shaped Rome: Rome’s political system; its ideas about family; aristocratic competition;  economy, agriculture and slavery; the roman army and society; the city of Rome and urban violence; the nature of Roman imperialism.",

Many were martyrs and miracle workers, but we also find holy madmen, transvestites, prostitutes. In this class we explore the diverse representations of sanctity in the hagiographical tradition of the Middle Ages, addressing both the literary and the historical questions raised therein. We ask how Christian communities in the later Roman Empire conceived of sanctity. We address questions of gender and empire, ritual and the body, memory and the use of the past. We explore the array of evidence for the cult of the saints—both literary and material—first in an attempt to understand the complex of practices and beliefs that accompany its emergence, but also to recognize more broadly what this institution can tell us about the Mediterranean world of late antiquity and Medieval Europe.",

With the conversion of Constantine and the coming of Imperial Christianity the basic structures of Byzantine civilization arise.

Seemingly in contradiction to these scientific developments, this was also the main period of witch trials. While Europe remained profoundly misogynist and hetero-normative, we also find startling cases of feminist ideas, radical gender expression, and queer sexualities.

We’ll work to understand why industrialization started in Britain and debate whether it needs to be renamed. We will then explore the economic, social, political and environmental consequences of industrialization in England, Scotland and Wales; including how urbanization and industrialization changed social and gender relations, creating new demands for democratic reform, unionization and women's rights. We will look at the global history of industrialization, from the cotton plantations, wheat fields, sheep stations, palm groves and copper mines that supplied raw materials to British factories, to the spread of industrial economies to Germany, North America, Japan and China. While exploring these interconnected histories, we will learn about different methods and approaches to history such as economic, social, political and environmental history. The history of the first modern industrial society; urbanization, democratization and class conflict; the rise of the labour movement, the triumph of middle-class values, the decline of the aristocracy; the changing religious and moral climate; the domestic consequences of world power; the social and economic impact of two world wars, the loss of world power.",

    "description": "This course examines the history of the Russian Empire from its origins to the fall of the monarchy in 1917. Understanding Imperial Russia is particularly important today, as Russia and the other former Soviet republics are searching for new political and social forms in the wake of communism’s collapse and are looking to the pre-revolutionary past as a source of political inspiration and national identity. The Russian tradition, from Peter I to Nicholas II, has become a hotly debated field of current political discourse both in Russia and in the West. A central question is whether the Russian tradition was a historical dead end, or a promise cut short by revolutionary violence? In considering this question, topics involving politics, social history, culture, gender, religion, and ethnicity will be discussed.",

Finally the course looks at the liberation and post-liberation period, considering the experiences of soldiers, exiles and refugees. In the final weeks, we will look at the creation of the African Diaspora and the processes of ‘development’ which have seen a renewed interest in Africa. We will ask to what extent this new interest might be considered neo-colonialism.",

How has the meaning of human rights changed over time? Finally, how does the CMHR present the history of human rights (or their violation), and in what ways do the museum’s choices influence the public’s understanding of that history? By engaging our senses as well as our critical faculties, the encounter with the museum will heighten our interest in the subject and facilitate transformative learning.",

Stemming from the dismantling of colonial empires and the creation of an infrastructure to manage the international economy near the end of Second World War, 'development' promised to end or dramatically reduce poverty around the world. Development policies ultimately failed to meet those goals and were replaced by neo- liberalism and arguments about good governance by the end of the 20th century. This course explores the idea of development and suggests the difficulties encountered in living up to its promises lie in its basic premises; reliant as they are on the continued desire to impose specific types of economic and social relations around the world---the continuation of what might be called the Menace of Progress. The course explores this history through an examination of post-independent economic policy in Africa, Asia and Latin America and an exploration of the history behind various ideas important to the concept of development: poverty, population and the expanded role of the market.",

But not everyone agreed with Herodotus’ approach. Most strikingly, his immediate successor, Thucydides, emphatically rejected his methodology and proposed an alternative. And subsequent writers regularly proposed alternative viewpoints regarding best approach to writing history. This course will trace the development of historical writing in the ancient world and explore the different approaches that Greek and Roman historians brought to the discipline by analyzing a variety of primary sources (in translation). In the process, we’ll explore questions about the purpose and methodology of history more broadly, including about how we practice it today.",

This course seeks to understand how the stereotypes of African sexuality, same-sex relationships and gender oppression were formed. Through a wide range of scholarly literature, primary sources, biographies and visual texts we will then move beyond this narrow focus and use historical studies to destabilize dominant assumptions about gender and sexuality in Africa. To do this we will use predominantly African texts and develop analytical tools appropriate to African contexts. In this way the course will provide rich accounts of African lives and how they shape and are shaped by issues of gender and sexuality.",

    "description": "By fusing humour with social criticism, satire allows authors to skewer societal customs and traditional practices while providing entertainment. Satire was popular among Greco-Roman authors, who found a ready audience for their biting critiques of prominent figures and contemporary social practices. Nothing was off limits for these writers, from destructive warmongering to illogical religious beliefs to the self-serving customs of the elite. And because these satires cover such a wide array of subjects, they provide the perfect lens through which to study the society and culture of the ancient world. In this course, we will analyze the satirical works of a number of Greek and Roman authors (e.g. Aristophanes, Lucian, Juvenal, etc.) in order to examine how they utilized this genre for social criticism and comedic effect, as well as what these works can tell us about the Greco-Roman world.",

This course takes a critical look at the varied deadly activities (munera, venationes, damnatio ad bestias), held in the Roman arena by examining ancient textual and visual sources, and modern scholarship. We will examine these spectacles in the broader context of Roman performance culture, religion and politics. Were these spectacles merely the product of a debased and declining culture?

Several questions guide this class: How has the world been imagined and experienced by Buddhists over time and over different geographies and cultures? What aspects of Buddhism are Westerners eager to see and what are they not interested in?",

In doing so, we will study inter-tribal borderlands, borderlands between Natives and newcomers, and the creation of borders between European powers. We will assess the impact and contributions that communities such as the Cree, Sioux, Nez Perce, Métis, Comanche, Iroquois and Coast Salish made to the demarcation, enforcement, and placement of European boundaries. Finally, we will compare the borderlands of North America to borderlands across the world, utilizing case studies from Europe, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Morocco. Throughout this process, we will focus on contentious issues such as violence, warfare, smuggling, prostitution, nation building, abductions, and racial exclusion.",

By examining the reaction of Chinese intellectuals to such scientific racial ideas, we will enrich our understanding of the utopic potency of eugenics as a solution to social ills such as poverty and disease. Reproduction is connected with ideologies of racial improvement such as eugenics, which also underpinned the One Child Policy in the 1980s. Chinese and international activists, writers and ideologues linked the population question, theories of degeneration and race suicide, birth control, and venereal disease to eugenics. Eugenics is intertwined with mental and physical health. Eugenics functions as an international ideology that also reinforces nationalism. The scientific argument has an explanatory value and legitimates the implementation of birth control and sterilization.",

We examine the political and ideological dimensions of Chinese feminism, in their intersections with nationalism, anarchism, socialism, and post-socialism. We learn of the contributions to feminist theory of radical anarcho-feminist He Yin-Zhen, explore the writings of talented female writers like swordswoman and revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin, or bourgeois writer turned Marxist Ding Ling, the first female writer to write the feminine self in Chinese literature. We explore prevalent Chinese practices such as foot binding, the separation of the sexes, arranged marriage, concubines, polygamy, free love, suicide, infanticide, leftover women, the marriage market, and Chinese lesbian cinema. We also look at major events and policies in Chinese history that affect women, such as the Rape of Nanjing, Western Colonialism, the Cultural Revolution and the female Red Guards, and the One Child Policy.",

By reading works based on thorough research we will see the intimate tie between the history of sexuality and military history. In this class we will expose the constructedness of gender and sexuality, and we will see how military conflicts had distinct impacts on the lives of women, men and children. Our investigation over the course of the semester will allow us to touch on a variety of themes including sexuality, gender, race, colonialism, citizenship, and more.

We examine how historians have contributed to popular understandings of drugs, alcohol, and intoxication and we consider what role social sciences and humanities scholars play in shaping our popular understandings of what makes good drugs and bad drugs, or how scholars and policy makers have determined limits for acceptable intoxicating behaviours and who has the privilege to be intoxicated, or who is criminalized for seeking intoxication. Rather than follow a chronological structure, in this course we examine how different psychoactive substances have been viewed in different places, from the perspectives of colonizers and colonized at different time points in history.",

    "class_name": "HIST433",
    "description": "The city of Rome evokes visions of conquest and empire, and of emperors and dictators. Augustus, establishing himself as Rome’s first emperor after decades of civil war, transformed Rome from ‘a city of brick to one of marble,’ imprinting the ideology of his rule, and of the eternity of empire in architecture. Two millennia later, in the 20th century, Benito Mussolini became il Duce, the founder of fascism, and Italy’s leader. Like Augustus, Mussolini stressed the need for the rebirth of the Italian nation after a long period of disunity and warfare. This entailed the creation of “new Italians” and the foundation of a “new Italy” of which Rome once again would be the symbolic centre, an embodiment of the glorious Roman imperial past, and of the glorious fascist present and future. Thus, the Rome of the emperors and the Rome of fascism are intimately linked. In this course we examine how Augustus and his successors, through architecture and other urban interventions, made Rome into the “Imperial city” par excellence, one that reflected their absolutist rule. At the same time we explore how Mussolini often appropriated (and sometimes destroyed) this ancient architectural heritage to create a city that reflected the socio-political ideals of Fascism. In this course, students will experience ancient and Fascist Rome in person, and will come to see how these two political systems used architecture, monuments and urban space as socio-political tools aimed at shaping their societies.",

Human dignity, decolonizing intellectuals realized, did not come with national independence and/or national citizenship.

Course themes include: the manifestation of “urban” or “municipal colonialism” as a key element of the colonial project; the erasure of Indigenous peoples from urban spaces; gendered and racialized colonial violence in urban spaces; the development of urban Indigenous social and political organizations; and, cities as Indigenous gathering spaces and places of resilience and resistance where Indigenous peoples continue to make space for themselves and their relations.",

    "description": "Explores the 'civilizing mission' that accompanied the spread of colonialism. Most countries argued that their endeavours benefited those who were to be colonized. They argued that colonialism would improve the habits of the colonized in economics, culture, religion, health, and sanitation. While almost universal in the colonial context, this argument was prevalent in the period of 'late' colonialism through the latter part of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. The course concentrates on its expression in Africa and India, with occasional examples drawn from the Caribbean and elsewhere. It focuses on general discussions of the civilizing mission then explores these arguments in more detail through an examination of specific elements of the ways colonial regimes attempted to alter the behaviour of the colonized and through examinations of how the colonizers came to believe they understood the colonized.",

    "class_name": "IS406",
    "description": "Individuals cannot solve the climate emergency, even if we all have a role to play. Neither can individual countries. Climate change is a collective action problem that requires international cooperation to transform the global economy by 2050. Building on the success of the Montreal Protocol, the United Nations has worked to bring its member nations together in a similar process to confront climate change. The results of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) Climate Change Conferences dating back to 1995 have been decidedly mixed. The United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol and the 2009 Copenhagen meeting failed to reach an agreement. In 2015, the Paris Agreement made a breakthrough, but subsequent COP meetings have struggled to find agreement on how to meet the Paris targets or adequately fund the Loss and Damage Fund. This course will focus on this international process, first by stepping back and exploring the historical context of climate science, planetary thinking, economic growth, denialism and obstruction, new technologies, and the efficacy of international environmental agreements. We will then work together to organize a mock future COP meeting, developing negotiating positions for different national governments with the goal of developing what a new agreement might look like that address competing national concerns (e.g. United States, China, India, Canada, the European Union, Nigeria, and Small Island Nations). We will also consider the role of non-governmental actors in the COP meeting and the success of the commitments (e.g. the United Nations, large banks, Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement, the climate tech sector, farmers organizations, and the major oil companies).",

As a distinctive component of the Canadian Indigenous governance landscape, Métis governance embodies a unique combination of influences from Indigenous and Western political traditions. The course first explores the birth of the Métis Nation, their interactions with colonial authorities, and the effects of historical policy and legislation on the Métis people, then critically examines Métis self-governance, exploring Métis law and policy, Indigenous rights and land claims, self-determination, and modern treaties.

Importantly, novel discoveries are often facilitated by “connecting the dots” between technologies, and thus students will be encouraged to think creatively when applying technologies to answer biological questions as they apply to plants. Biotechnology has its basis in a deep understanding of the biology and evolution of plants, and thus each lecture week is organized around a concept which connects (1) natural variation in plants, (2) the cutting-edge technologies used to query different aspects of plant biology, and (3) the much-needed applications of these technological advances to the world around you.",

The course concludes by using a case study approach to consider the above issues in greater detail in select political contexts across Africa, Latin America, North America and Oceania.\n",

However, despite there being no overarching authority, international actors have developed international organizations, laws, and norms to provide rules and structures to manage transnational relations and contribute to the solutions for problems of global scope. While some view international organizations and law as simply a means by which powerful states pursue their own interests, others argue that international law has power beyond politics and can rein in self-interest and provide the means and methods for cooperation, coordination, and respect for human rights. This course introduces students to the history, design, and contemporary operations of some of the legal structures underpinning international relations, such as the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court, and explores how politics and law interact in shaping contemporary international relations and the lives of individuals globally.",

    "description": "This course critically examines the needs of a community in the aftermath of conflict and explores various approaches to peace-building and justice as attempted in northern Uganda. Uganda has struggled, and continues to struggle, with difficult decisions about how to address legacies of violence and human rights violations. For two decades (1986-2006), northern Uganda was the site of fear and violence as the rebel group ‘the Lord’s Resistance Army’ terrorized communities with brutality and kidnapping, creating and maintaining a force of attacking child soldiers. Also accused of atrocity is the government and its army, the UPDF. Uganda came into the spotlight as local and international human rights practitioners debated peace-vs-justice, especially with regards to the imposition of international criminal justice (the first indictments from the International Criminal Court in 2005; first and only conviction happened in March 2021) and the abilities of traditional mechanisms of justice to address mass atrocity and promote reconciliation. There have also been questions about the need or usefulness of a truth and reconciliation commission or possibly the need for vetting in the Ugandan UPDF, (among the options of mechanisms to pursue justice and reconciliation). This study abroad course explores practical questions of transitional justice using Uganda as a case study.",

The course has three (3) modules: In module 1, students will be introduced to basic knowledge on leadership (definitions, theories, styles). Subsequently, unique aspects of leadership in public health that distinguishes it from generic/business leadership will be explored. In module 2, students will be introduced to LEADS (Lead self, Engage others, Achieve results, Develop coalitions, Systems transformation). It was recently established that most of the competencies in public health leadership mapped well with “LEADS in a caring environment” leadership framework\n(CHNC, 2015). LEADS is a well-established framework for leadership development in Canada, and “embodies key skills, behaviors, abilities and knowledge required to lead in all sectors of the economy and types of organizations” (LEADScanada.ca). Finally, in module 3, the leadership competencies specific for public health practice in Canada will be addressed.

Next, we will explore how the people of Japan, from early modern to \ncontemporary times, share a common awareness of religion that provides worldly benefits. This \ncourse will therefore place a particular emphasis on the understanding of religion as it has been, \nand continues to be practiced in everyday life for individuals, families, communities, and the \nstate. This means we must consider religion and culture not as abstract, monolithic and \nahistorical phenomena, but as expressions of the social realm. Class readings will center on \nprimary materials in English translation and selected secondary scholarship so that each student \nwill consider for themselves the sectarian categories of Buddhism, Confucianism, Shintoism, \nNew Religions, and so forth.",

    "description": "This course will examine the representations of Islam and Muslims as they appear or are portrayed in the Hollywood film industry. From the early twentieth century up until the present era of the global War on Terrorism, Hollywood has manufactured images of Islam that have been closely intertwined with the dynamics of political and economic interests and ideological motives to dominate Other. Through lectures, discussion, and the screening of selected movies – from the classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to post 9/11 films such as The Kingdom (2007) – we will closely analyze what has changed in the representations of Islam, what persists, and why. This course is not an entirely movie-based review and analysis. However, in order to present the images of Hollywood’s Islam in the lectures and discussion, the screening of selected movies is inevitable. This course will be divided into three themes: classical Oriental depictions of Islam (which portrayed Muslims as exotic, sensual, and irrational); national security concerns, from the post-1979 Iranian revolution to the Gulf War, and; the global War on Terrorism after 9/11.\n",

In this course, through the examination of scholarly approaches taken up by folklorists and ethnographers to the study of ritual, we will investigate several sites of Ukrainian traditional and post-traditional culture in order to understand complex processes of cultural continuity and cultural change. What is the ritual and how can ritual analysis help us to enter the domain of Ukrainian culture? Is ritual only about traditional Ukrainian weddings, Christmas and Easter celebrations, or can such events as Taras Shevchenko’s reburial, the Orange and Euromaidan Revolutions of 2004 and 2013, and recent political events in Ukraine be studied similarly, as well? And why ritual? How can ritual account for the dynamic nature of ethnic or nation building processes? What can it teach us about ourselves, our history, our culture? These and other questions will be addressed in class.",

The course is divided into four units of study including a foundational unit in cultural studies theory and three additional units each of which focuses on a unique cultural text, product, phenomena, practice or archive. Each unit will examine relationships between cultural texts/ cultural phenomena and their ideological and socio-historical contexts. \n",

The use of the term ‘queer and sexualities’ studies is intended to include recent developments in trans studies. Students will explore the intersections of queer and sexualities theories with critical race, disabilities, intersex and transnational perspectives, in preparation for a community-engagement research project that investigates everyday struggles for actualization in evolving constructions of queer-positive publics. \n",
