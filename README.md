# PlanMyCourse
This is a full stack application designed for students at USASK,to help them plan and figure out which classes they still need to take and check each class prerequisites without having to navigate to another page. This app would also allow users to create reviews and comments on classes.

## How To Run This Project: 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  

### Steps to Run
**Clone the repo**
```
git clone https://git.cs.usask.ca/kbv851/PlanMyCourse.git planmycourse
```
**Change terminal directory into root project file**
```
cd planmycourse
```
**Copy .env variables**
```
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```
**Initialize the data base**
```
docker-compose up -d db
```
**Initialize the scraper**
```
docker-compose up -d scraper
```
**Scrape Data** 

This might take a while since it is scraping a lot of USASK courses. Might take up to 3-5 minutes. You will know when it is done 
when it says after the "Connected to database" that of the phrase: "courses and prerequisites have been added successfully" and 
"courses.json already exists."
```
docker exec -it course_scraper python courseScraper.py
```
**Build Docker**
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
**Build Docker Up**
```
docker-compose up -d
```
**Start the server**
```
docker logs -f main_server
```
**Start the frontend**

Make sure you are on a different terminal (still the same directory as before) when you run this command:
```
docker logs -f main_frontend
```
**To stop docker**
```
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing any permission issues or are having issues with running the docker commands run `sudo` after every docker command.

`Note:` This issue might occur if you are on a UNIX (Linux or Mac) device 

**Example**
```
sudo docker-compose up -d db
```

**For Mac Users**

Instead of `docker-compose` use `docker compose`
