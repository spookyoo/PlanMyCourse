## Description
This is a full stack application designed for students at USASK,to help them plan and figure out which classes they still need to take and check each class prerequisites without having to navigate to another page. This app would also allow users to create reviews and comments on classes.

    Once you have node installed
    clone the project to a local repo

    If no errors occur, cd into the frontend folder and run:
